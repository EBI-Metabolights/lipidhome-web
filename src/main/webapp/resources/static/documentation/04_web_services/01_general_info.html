<h1>Web Services General Info</h1>

<p>The Webserice of the `LipidHome'  web application are a simple way to computationally retrieve data from the underlying database in a standardised manner. There are several different request URLs with different parameters and return values. However, they all share in common the data interchange format JSON as the return type. It is worth noting that the web services will become more advanced and evolve over time, as such it is worth keeping an eye on the help documentation in the main application hosted at <a = href = "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/lipidhome/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/lipidhome/</a>. All web services are available under the root path <a href = "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/lipidhome/service">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/lipidhome/service</a> and the following section's location should be appended to this root to access them.</p>

<h2>Utility services</h2>
Utility services is a catch all group of services necessary for varying aspect of the web application to run, most of them are application specific and uninteresting to interested data consumers. However the search functionality of the `LipidHome' database is provided as a web service under /utils. The result is a list of items in the database that match the search text at the level specified and some basic information about them such as whether they are identified or not.

<h3>/search</h3>
Takes several parameters;

<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Parameter</th>
		<th>Values</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>query</td>
		<td>Any string</td>
	</tr>
		<tr>
		<td>type</td>
		<td>Any of "CATEGORY", "MAIN_CLASS", "SUB_CLASS", "SPECIE", "FA_SCAN_SPECIE", "SUB_SPECIE", "ISOMER" AND "ALL''</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>start</td>
